		<h3>Context</h3>
		<p style="text-indent:48px;">The first time I heard about The Great Gatsby, it had been from that famous clip of Leonardo DiCaprio's Gatsby tilting his glass towards the camera from the 2013 Baz Luhrmann adaptation of the book. Ever since then, it's always kind of been there in the back of my mind as a book to get around to eventually. However, I wouldn't actually read it until it was an assigned reading in my 10th Grade English Honors class. Now, whenever a book is an assigned reading, I'm always predisposed to the fact that I'll very likely dislike the book. However, this did not end up happening with The Great Gatsby.</p>
		<h3>Review</h3>
		<p style="text-indent:48px;">The Great Gatsby is a book that won't be for everybody, but I loved it. Everyone in the book has a very complex, deep, and interesting relationship with everyone else in the book. The mystery of who Gatsby is is written very well, and I constantly felt engaged with the seemingly extravigent yet simultaniously broken lives of these characters. The themes about the failure of the American dream hold close to me personally, and the writing techniques Fitzgerald employs, most notably his use of semicolons, are so interesting to read and analyze. I'm coming at this book as someone who loves literary realism, and seeing the everyday lives of people examined and ripped apart really appeals to me. The setting of the Jazz Age also helps to increase the interesting aspects of these characters lives, being shiny and glimmery. I can understand why many won't end up liking it, but for me, it was an absolute gem, and so far my favorite book of all time.</p>
